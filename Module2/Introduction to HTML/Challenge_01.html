        <h1>Don't Quit</h1>

        <p>
        When things go wrong as they sometimes will;<br>
        When the road you’re trudging seems all uphill;<br>
        When the funds are low, and the debts are high;<br>
        And you want to smile, but you have to sigh;<br>
        When care is pressing you down a bit<br>
        Rest if you must, but don’t you quit.</p>

        <p>
        Success is failure turned inside out;<br>
        The silver tint of the clouds of doubt;<br>
        And you can never tell how close you are;<br>
        It may be near when it seems afar.<br>
        So, stick to the fight when you’re hardest hit –<br>
        It’s when things go wrong that you mustn’t quit.<br>
        </p>
